## BASIC
**Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)** is a computer vision algorithm, introduced by **David Lowe** in 1999 and refined in 2004. It describes local features in images that are invariant to scale, rotation, illumination [照明], and viewpoint changes, enabling robust object recognition, image stitching [图像拼接], and 3D reconstruction.
