description: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an essential too for analyzing a signal's frequency content. One common operation before applying FFT is zero-padding, appending zeros to the end of a signal to increase the total number of samples used in the transform.

# Zero-padding
Zero-padding refers to adding extra zero-valued smaples to the time domain signal before performing the FFT.

# The benefits
## Increase the number of FFT Bins (Spectral Interpolation)
Zero-padding increases the number of frequency points in the FFT output, effectively interpolating the original FFT bins. This operation does not add new frequency information, but it:

+ interpolate the existing spectrum.
+ make the spectrum look smoother and more continuous.
+ helps locate peaks more precisely.

##  Zero-Padded FFT-Based Convolution
In FFT-based convolution, zero-padding is required to prevent **<font style="color:#DF2A3F;">time-domain aliasing</font>**. When convolving two signals of length   
ùëÅ and ùëÄ, the FFT length must be at least ùëÅ+ùëÄ‚àí1.

#  What Zero-Padding _Does Not Do_
##  **Does Not Improve Frequency **_**Resolution**_
 While zero-padding increases the number of FFT bins, it does **not improve the frequency resolution** in the physical sense. The frequency resolution depends on the duration of the signal:

$ \Delta f=\frac{1}{T} $

where, $ T $is the time span of the original signal.

Zero-padding cannot overcome the limitations imposed by a short time window.

It's important to understand that all the additional points are derived through mathematical interpolation ‚Äî no new data is being introduced.  

## Example
### Set Up Sampling Parameters and Frequencies  
```c
fs = 1000;          % Sampling rate (samples per second, or Hz)
f1 = 50; f2 = 52;   % Two sine wave frequencies close to each other
amp = 1;            % Amplitude of the sine waves
```

+  Two closely spaced frequencies: 50 Hz and 52 Hz.  
+  Sampling rate is 1000 Hz.  

###  Generate a Short-Duration Signal (0.2 seconds)  
```c
T1 = 0.2;
t1 = 0:1/fs:T1-1/fs;
x1 = amp*sin(2*pi*f1*t1) + amp*sin(2*pi*f2*t1);
```

This creates a short signal that lasts 0.2 seconds.

The signal $ x_1 $ is a sum of the two sine waves (50 Hz and 52 Hz).

Frequency resolution is: $ \Delta f = \frac{1}{0.2 S} = 5 Hz $

###  Generate a Long-Duration Signal (2 seconds)  
```c
T2 = 2;
t2 = 0:1/fs:T2-1/fs;
x2 = amp*sin(2*pi*f1*t2) + amp*sin(2*pi*f2*t2);
```

+ This creates a **longer signal** lasting 2 seconds.
+ Frequency resolution improves to: $ \Delta f = \frac{1}{2 S} = 0.5 Hz $
+ This higher resolution allows us to separate the two close frequencies.

###  Compute FFT with Zero-Padding
```c
X1 = fft(x1, 4096);
X2 = fft(x2, 4096);
f = (0:4095)*(fs/4096);  % Frequency axis
```

+ Both signals are **zero-padded to 4096 points** before computing FFT.
+ This increases the number of frequency bins, but **does not change the actual resolution**.

###  Plot the Spectra  
```c

figure
subplot(2,1,1);
plot(f, abs(X1), "LineWidth", 2); xlim([40 60]);
title('Short signal (0.2s) ‚Äî Resolution = 5 Hz');
set(gca,'FontSize',15, "FontName","Times New Roman");
subplot(2,1,2);
plot(f, abs(X2), "LineWidth", 2); xlim([40 60]);
title('Long signal (2s) ‚Äî Resolution = 0.5 Hz');
set(gca,'FontSize',15, "FontName","Times New Roman");
```

+ The top subplot shows the FFT of the **short signal** ‚Äî the two sine waves are not clearly separated.
+ The bottom subplot shows the FFT of the **long signal** ‚Äî the two sine waves appear as two distinct peaks.
